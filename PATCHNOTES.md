With Randy random the application is able to buy and sell at random.
Why would we ever do this?
Due to that just like a cat picking who will win a bunch of football matches we might be able to do well at random.
There is still some things that need to be fixt in this patch.

The name Randy random comes from the game [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/).<br >
[Randy Random](https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Randy_Random), is a wild storyteller whose main characteristic is triggering challenges at any time of any difficulty, to the extent of launching several dangerous threats all at the same time or consecutively.
