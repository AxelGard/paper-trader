# Versioning - paper-trader

### [v2.0 - alpaca lib](https://github.com/AxelGard/paper-trader/releases/tag/v2.0)

In the second version realise of paper-trader I have introduced the official alpaca lib for python.
Because of this introduction of the library we are able to add a lot of new functions. 
I have moved the key file so you might need to move that if you are using a older version. 
There is also a lot of bug fixes in this version. 

**this version is a more stable version then v1.0 so if you have been using v1.0 you should upgrade**

### [v2.0 - coming soon](https://github.com/AxelGard/paper-trader/releases/tag/v2.0)

I will be releasing version v2.0 soon in v2.0 the major change from v1.0 is that in v2.0 I have used the alpaca library for python.
With that library I was able to add a lot of new features and fix bugs.
Of curse you can already find most of v2.0 in the master branch.
I have been testing the new version but soon it will be ready.
I am still running the old version on my main server for trading,
but when the new version is relist I will also move that server to v2.0.
This also means that will be retiring the old version more or less,
so you should use v2.0 when it's has been released.

### [v1.0 - first version](https://github.com/AxelGard/paper-trader/releases/tag/v1.0)

The first version of the paper-trader.
This version of the paper-trader uses the alpaca REST API over https.
In v1.0, I used python requests for sending orders.

**be aware that this version has some problems and should not be used for professional trading.**

feel free to use but at your own risk
